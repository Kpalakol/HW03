<!-- ##Documentation of Source Code -->
        The given source code contains a program that traverses through the directory 
        structure and displays the contents of the directories and their files in a 
        specific format based on the input provided by the user. The program is 
        written in C language and uses various system libraries 
        like stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, dirent.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h, and time.h.

<!-- Functions -->

The program uses several functions to accomplish its tasks:

        void E_e_run(char *dummy[1028]): 
                This function executes the input command in the terminal 
                by creating a child process and running the command in it.

        void print_file_info(const char *path, const char *name, int file_details_flag): 
                This function prints information about a file in a specified format. 
                It takes the path and name of the file and a flag indicating whether 
                to display the details of the file or not.

        void traverse_directory(char *dir_path, int indent, int file_details_flag, 
                                int size_flag, int max_size, int file_flag, char *pattern, 
                                int max_depth, int tflag, int isFiles, int esetBit): 
                This function traverses through the directory structure and displays 
                the contents of the directories and their files in a specific format 
                based on the input provided by the user. It takes various flags as input 
                to decide which information to display and in what format.

<!-- Input Flags -->
The program accepts various flags as input to customize the output:

        -S: This flag indicates whether to display the sizes of files and directories or not.

        -s <size>: This flag indicates the maximum size of files to be displayed.

        -t d/f: This flag indicates whether to display only directories (d) or files (f).

        -f <string> <depth>: This flag indicates whether to search for files with a specific pattern or not upto a aparticular depth level

        -E : Executes only once with given list of files and uses fork/exec system commands

        -e : Executes one after another for every file and uses system commands like above

<!-- Usage -->
        The program can be run using the following commands:
                To run: ./a.out -S
                        ./a.out -s <size>
                        ./a.out -t d
                        ./a.out -t f
                        ./a.out -f
                        ./a.out -S -s <size>
                        ./a.out -S -s <size> -t d
                        ./a.out -S -s <size> -t f 
                        ./a.out -f a 2
                        ./a.out -f jpg 1
                        ./a.out -S -s 1024 -f jpg 3
                        ./a.out -e "unix command"
                        ./a.out -E "Unix Command"
                        ./a.out -S -e "unix command"
                        ./a.out -S -E "unix command"


<!-- Conclusion -->
        In conclusion, the given source code contains a program that traverses through the directory structure and displays the contents of the directories and their files in a specific format based on the input provided by the user. The program uses various system libraries and functions to accomplish its tasks and accepts various input flags to customize the output.It also runs unix commands on list of files obtained from s,s,f,t commands with the help of -e and -E commands using fork/exec system calls.
